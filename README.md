## Manipulating Bounds Extensions for Desired Bounding Boxes
Make sure the SM "Build Scale" is 1,1,1 before manipulating the bounds extensions. SM pivot point should be set to the centre of the SM, this can be done with Pivot Tool or something similar.
Then run one of these for your selected Static Meshes:
* ChangeBoundsExtensionForSMassetspath.py
* ChangeBoundsExtensionForSMs_inFolder.py
